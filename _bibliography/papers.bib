abstract = {The chaos of flow turbulence causes most quantity-of-interests J to become significantly non-convex over time, so that gradients of J soon fail to guide numerical simulations toward a useful local optimum. This challenge is investigated, and a multi-step penalty method is introduced to circumvent it, for the common case in which a relatively deterministic, and hence controllable, component of the flow is masked by the chaos. To do this the simulation time is divided into intervals, with periods approximating the chaos time scales, and solution discontinuity ∆q are introduced between the intervals. Model systems show how this temporarily enlarges search scale by making a related JA more convex. The discontinuities are then increasingly penalized to approach the ∆q → 0 physical limit. The challenge and method are illustrated with a logistics map, the Lorenz system, and an advection augmented Kuramoto–Sivashinsky Equation, before application to turbulent Kolmogorov flow, for which it far outperforms standard adjoint-based gradient search. The utility of such an optimized chaotic solution is discussed.},

abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation methods are attractive for representing species distribution functions in plasmas. However, as a model, they introduce uncertain parameters, and for quantifying their prediction uncertainty it is useful to be able to assess the sensitivity of a quantity-of-interest (QoI) to these parameters. Such sensitivity information is likewise useful for optimization. However, computing sensitivity for PIC methods is challenging due to the chaotic particle dynamics, and sensitivity techniques remain underdeveloped compared to those for Eulerian discretizations. This challenge is examined from a dual particle–continuum perspective that motivates a new sensitivity discretization. Two routes to sensitivity computation are presented and compared: a direct fully-Lagrangian particle-exact approach provides sensitivities of each particle trajectory, and a new particle-pdf discretization, which is formulated from a continuum perspective but discretized by particles to take the advantages of the same type of Lagrangian particle description leveraged by PIC methods. Since the sensitivity particles in this approach are only indirectly linked to the plasma-PIC particles, they can be positioned and weighted independently for efficiency and accuracy. The corresponding numerical algorithms are presented in mathematical detail. The advantage of the particle-pdf approach in avoiding the spurious chaotic sensitivity of the particle-exact approach is demonstrated for Debye shielding and sheath configurations. In essence, the continuum perspective makes implicit the distinctness of the particles, which circumvents the Lyapunov instability of the N-body PIC system. The cost of the particle-pdf approach is comparable to the baseline PIC simulation.},
